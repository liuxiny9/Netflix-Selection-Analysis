# Netflix-Selection-Analysis

This is the final project i chose for General Assembly Python Class. 

As a super user of Netflix, I have always been interested in Netflix's operation and selection strategy. In this analysis, I explored several interesting topics such as how timeliness Netflix is and their selection strategy in US and other mega-region. 

This is only of my very first projects of using Python for data analytics. Please feel free to contribute if you see any opportunities to improve and automate.
